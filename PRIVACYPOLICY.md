# FrostByte Privacy Policy

**"Your snowbound guardian of privacy."** ❄️

At FrostByte, protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when using FrostByte on your Discord server. We value transparency and want you to feel secure knowing your data is treated with the utmost respect.

FrostByte is built with a strong focus on **security**, **privacy**, and **simplicity**, ensuring that your data remains in your hands. We have a strict **No Save Policy**, meaning that we do not store or use any data that is not directly required for the app's operation, and any data that is not readily accessible via the Discord app is **never** saved or used in any way.

## Information We Collect

FrostByte collects only the information needed to provide its features and functionality within your Discord server. This includes:

1. **Discord User Information**: FrostByte interacts with your Discord server, and thus we collect certain basic user details such as Discord IDs, usernames, roles, and permissions. This data is used solely to perform moderation and configuration tasks within the app.

2. **Server Information**: When you invite FrostByte to your server, we collect server details such as server ID, server name, and the channels the app has access to. This information is required for FrostByte to operate on your server and provide its features.

3. **Command Usage Data**: We collect anonymized data about the commands you use within FrostByte. This helps us improve the app’s performance, fix bugs, and enhance user experience. However, no personally identifiable data is collected from command usage.

## Our Strict "No Save" Policy

FrostByte adheres to a strict **No Save Policy**, which means:

- **No File Storage**: FrostByte does **not** save or process any files shared within your server. This includes images, videos, or any other types of media. If you share files through Discord, FrostByte does not store them.
  
- **No Audio Storage**: We do **not** save, record, or process any audio within your server, whether it’s from voice channels or any other source. FrostByte does not interact with or store audio data in any way.

- **No Identifying Information**: FrostByte only collects the minimum necessary data, like user IDs and server IDs, which are publicly accessible via Discord's API. We do **not** store, process, or use any additional identifying information about you or your server members beyond what is readily available in Discord.

- **No Personal Messages**: FrostByte does **not** store or process any personal messages sent within your server. The app interacts with the Discord API only to provide its features, and any messages or conversations within the server are not retained.

Any data not immediately available via Discord’s public API is **never saved**, **never used**, and **never processed** by FrostByte.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect strictly for the following purposes:

- **Functionality**: To allow FrostByte to function correctly on your server, including configuring permissions, managing logs, and executing commands.
  
- **Improvement**: To improve FrostByte’s features, resolve bugs, and enhance the user experience based on how the app is used.

- **Security**: To protect your server from unauthorized access and misuse, and to ensure the app's functionality remains secure.

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties, and we do **not** use your data for advertising or other commercial purposes.

## Data Security

FrostByte is built with modern security measures to ensure your data is protected. We employ best practices in encryption and data protection to keep your server and user information secure.

However, please remember that no system can guarantee 100% security. We are committed to continuously improving our security practices to safeguard your data.

---

## Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary to provide our services. Upon removing FrostByte from your server, all data associated with your server and its settings is deleted within a reasonable timeframe.

This includes:

- Server information (such as server ID and settings).
- Command usage data (anonymized).
- Logs and permissions settings.

Any data that FrostByte does not need for ongoing functionality is immediately discarded and **never stored** beyond what is required.

## Your Privacy Choices

You have control over the information FrostByte collects and how it interacts with your server. Here are some privacy options available to you:

1. **Permissions**: You can configure FrostByte’s permissions using Discord’s built-in permission system or set custom permissions within the app. This allows you to control what FrostByte can access on your server.

2. **Log Channel Configuration**: You can configure a **log channel** to track certain events, but rest assured, no sensitive data will be logged or stored outside of this configuration.

3. **Command Privacy**: FrostByte does not track personal information through commands, but we encourage you to avoid sharing sensitive data in command inputs.

If you ever wish to delete your data or have privacy-related concerns, please reach out to us through the provided support channels.
