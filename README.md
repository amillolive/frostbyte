# FrostByte

**"FrostByte, your snowbound guide."** ❄️

FrostByte is a cutting-edge Discord app designed to revolutionize command-based moderation. Unlike many apps that have been around for years without significant innovation, FrostByte brings a fresh approach with a focus on security, privacy, and ease of use. With a charming polar bear persona, FrostByte is not only functional but also thoughtful about the privacy of its users' data.

This Discord app is built using **hikari**, a modern, statically typed framework for Python3 and asyncio, designed to interact with Discord's REST and Gateway APIs. It is built with the intention of being extendable and reusable, ensuring a solid foundation for future updates.

Additionally, FrostByte uses **hikari-lightbulb**, a command handler built specifically for **hikari**, designed to streamline the creation and management of commands, allowing for seamless integration and customization of the app’s features.

## Description

FrostByte is a Discord app designed to enhance moderation on your server. With a dynamic configuration system, FrostByte gives server administrators the ability to tailor the app's behavior to meet their needs. The app is built with a focus on security and privacy, ensuring that your data stays protected.

FrostByte is powered by **hikari**, a modern framework for building high-performance Discord apps, and **hikari-lightbulb**, which simplifies command creation and management while working directly with **hikari** for seamless integration.

## Installation

FrostByte is simple to add to your Discord server. To get started, just invite the app using the invite link provided below. It will be up and running in no time!

1. [Invite FrostByte to your server](#)  
2. Follow the easy on-screen instructions in Discord to configure the app.

## Features

- **Dynamic Configuration**: After inviting the app, you can configure various settings such as log channels and permissions, either using Discord’s default permission system or customizing the app’s settings for more granular control.
- **Security & Privacy**: FrostByte takes privacy seriously, with a codebase designed to ensure your data is kept secure and not misused.
- **Command-Based Interaction**: The app operates through a simple command-based system. Administrators can use commands to configure settings and manage the app’s behavior.

*Note: This is an early development version, so expect more features and improvements over time.*

## Configuration

FrostByte is highly configurable, and upon inviting it to your server, you can choose between two configuration models:

1. **Discord-Based Permissions (default)**: FrostByte will follow the default Discord permission system.
2. **App-Side Permissions**: If you prefer, you can configure FrostByte’s permissions independently within the app’s settings for more flexibility.

You can also configure a **log channel** to keep track of important events and ensure transparency within your server.

## Usage

Once FrostByte is added to your server, interacting with it is straightforward. The app uses a **command-based system**, allowing administrators to issue commands to configure settings, moderate, and manage the app's features.

To see a list of available commands, simply type `>help` (or the configured prefix) in your server, and FrostByte will provide a helpful guide.
